# EBISS2023: Causal Artificial Intelligence

The scientific method aims at the discovery and modeling of causal relationships from data. It is not enough to know that smoking and cancer are correlated; the important thing is to know that if we start smoking or stop smoking, it will change our chance of getting cancer. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning as it exists today does not take causation into account and instead make predictions based on statistical associations. This can give rise to problems when they are used in environments in which the associations used are not necessarily fulfilled or when such models are used for decision making. This picture has begun to change with recent advances in techniques for causal inference, which make it possible (under certain circumstances) to measure causal relationships from observational and experimental data and, in general, to make formal reasoning about cause and effect. As we will discuss in the talk, the convergence between machine learning and causal inference opens the door to answering questions relevant to many AI tasks.
